This is exam is submitted by Romeo Fernandez

- Unity version 2021.3.13f1
- Plugins installed
  - LeanTween
  - Zenject
- Please see payline worksheet, all of them are 20
- I was not able to draw the payout lines after each spin due to lack of time, but
  the compute results is already basing its logic on the 20 paylines.
- Installed and tested the apk, its already working ok.
- Payout results are done but I ran out of time outputting it on the right format,
  you can check it in SlotMachineController.cs=>ComputeResults()
